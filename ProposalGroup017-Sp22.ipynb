    "As a current global shortage of semiconductor chips used in the majority of cars, SUVs and trucks, automakers in the world are facing the limit of the production for their new vehicle. Our goal for this project is to predict the used car prices and bring the benefits to car shoppers to encourage or avoid their purchase decision on the specific cars or brands. Our team will use the datasets from the used car pricing site ‘TrueCar’. The dataset will contain various key  factors regarding used car’s information"

However, we understand that in processing vehicular sales data, the VIN or identifiable information pertaining to the car is revealed in sales ads, and so on. This provides us with records of car maintenance and thereby the locations of previous owners, which may hold a risk. However, this is not unique to the dataset, but rather openly provided information for the sake of transparency - products such as CARFAX have been using this information for buyer transparency without any apparent ethical violations. In that sense, we are aware but not concerned about privacy risks\n",

    "We spent significant time trying to imagine the ethical implications of such a project. It is entirely true that every machine learning project is liable to have intrinsic interactions with ethics, but in this case we think that these pertain to how such a project can be used, rather than in the making of the project. For example, the outputs of our model could be used to monitor car prices, and manipulate sales as opposed to an organic market. However, such metrics of what cars are “worth” and “market value” have already been established, and we believe the likely usage of this model would be to track the perpetuation of car values in a market heavily impacted by the pandemic and its ensuing shortages in components\n",
